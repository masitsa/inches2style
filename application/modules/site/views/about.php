            <strong>Mission Statement:</strong> Style and elegance is something I believe can easily be attained with just a little guidance. By looking beyond fashion and understanding yourself, your body, fashion trends and your environment, it is possible to make fashions work for you instead of you becoming a slave to fashion. Hence, by reading this blog, I hope to help people discover and maintain their unique personal style and move Inches to Style.

                I am a fashion and style blogger and personal shopper/stylist living in Nairobi, Kenya. Writing is one of my favorite things to do and what better way to put two things I absolutely love than by creating a fashion blog. I started this blog in September 2011. And in 2013, as an extension of my writing, I have opened an online shop to make available women’s clothing and accessories.

                I believe that to dress well, we need to understand our bodies, both inside and out, to know what makes us the unique individuals that we are and to understand clothing, what is on fashion, what withstands the tests of time and how we can use fashions to express who we are. For me, dressing is not just about buying clothes that I see everybody else wearing or how much money you spend on clothes. You can spend KSh.5000 on a dress or KSh. 500 and still look stylish and elegant. Dressing is more about learning what works for me and what doesn’t, selecting those clothes that suit my body type and personality rather than joining the bandwagon and wearing anything and everything. This blog is set out to inspire people that style is attainable to any person no matter what their background, financial situation and personal interests. To further this point, I have created the Fashion Commentary series where I discuss and give my point of view on some fashion trends and how they have been interpreted in my hometown, Nairobi, as well as give options on how these trends can be worn to flatter the individual rather than make them look as if they are trying too hard.</p>

<p>Apart from dressing, I believe elegance comes from the refinement of your inner self as well as your outer self. It makes very little sense to be dressed to kill and not have basic good habits in both manners and health, thus, the Lifestyle section of this blog and the Mid-Week Reflections series that comes every month.</p>

<p>All in all, it is my belief that by reading, researching, soul-searching and experimenting you will move slowly but surely Inches To Style.</p>

                 In order to help people dress stylishly and elegantly, I have opened my online shop. How does this work? Instead of selling clothes en masse, each of my customers gets personal attention when it comes to shopping for their wardrobe. Through a one-on-one conversation, clients are encouraged to provide as much information about their personal style preferences i.e. favorite styles and colours. </p>
 
<p>Armed with as much info as I can get from the client, I source clothes and give them an opportunity to select those that they truly love. This personalized shopping experience has proved very satisfactory among many of my clients since their specific needs are attended to and met individually.
